# xextool GUI v2.0

xextool GUI 
is a graphical user interface for the xextool v6.6 from xorloser.
This means you can easily use the xextool without working via the command line.

I thought I had lost this program forever
I accidentally found my 2.0 version on an old USB stick.

Unfortunately I no longer have the source code.

# So if anyone is interested, they are welcome to decompile the program to get the source code.
